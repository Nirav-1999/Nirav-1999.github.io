The human body is comprised of many different elements that help in the proper functioning of
the body. One such element is the blood. It contains about 7 percent of the human body by weight
and controls and co-ordinates many functions of the body. It comprises different types of cells,
namely, RBCs (Red Blood Cells), WBCs (White Blood Cells) and blood platelets, which helps in
the body's proper functioning. Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests are the ones that are most
commonly prescribed by doctors whenever the body faces an illness. CBC tests are used to count
the number of WBC's, RBC's, and Platelets in the blood. The traditional methods for performing
CBC tests are time-consuming and costly. The two methods used for CBC tests nowadays include
"Coulter Counters and Laser Flow Cytometry" (automated machine-based counting) and the
"Manual Way" (Manual counting). What if these tests can be conducted as quickly and as
efficiently as possible? What if all the costly and heavy machinery is replaced by cheap and quick
computer technology? This chapter proposes a method to count the number of WBC's, RBC's, and
Platelets using a deep learning method called Faster R-CNN. The proposed methodology uses a
dataset of microscopic images of blood cells which have been annotated and augmented for RBC's,
WBC's, and blood platelets. This method uses these images to train the model, and then the model
identifies the individual number of WBC's, RBC's and Platelets in the given images (i.e., in a single microscopic frame), which can then be extrapolated to get the final blood count.
