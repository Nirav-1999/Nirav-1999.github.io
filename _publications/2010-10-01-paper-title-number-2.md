Abstract
======
Previous works have shown that it is possible to reliably generate coherent waveforms of good quality by employing a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN). With an intent to improve the stability of the GAN and enhance the quality of the generated audio, we propose a modified version of MelGAN. We combine Self-Attention with MelGAN architecture. Self-attention GAN have shown improved results in the generation of high-quality images. To make use of the Self- Attention layer’s quality of establishing long-range dependencies in audio generation, we embed a one-dimensional self-attention within the MelGAN’s generator. In this paper, we use the LJ Speech Dataset to train MelGAN as well as our proposed architecture. To interpret the results, we calculate and compare the Mean Opinion Scores and Mean Opinion Score- Listening Quality Objective of both the architectures trained until the thousandth epoch.
