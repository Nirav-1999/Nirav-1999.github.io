Hi there,
------
I am Nirav from Mumbai, India. I am a final year student at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi College of Engineering and currently I am pursuing Computer Engineering as my undergraduate major. Studying at D.J. Sanghvi I realized my interest for computer vision in robotics and I wish to advance my knowledge in the field by pursuing the same through a master's program. I have participated in a couple of robotics competitions and also have several publications under my authorship. I like to innovate and expand my knowledge base to its acme. Through this I wish to create a positive impact on the society and help the society in any possible way.
